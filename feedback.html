                    Heyyyy guyss 
                        Iam nimna .........
                        It's been one month since I started my LEVEL UP SEPTEMBER journey for a new version of myself and it's going great I can feel the lill changes that happened to me
                        I finally decided to do something for myself and firstly I tried  a wheel of life and realised my weekpoints and decided the area's I need to focus on and for this month I choose personal growth 
                        and then I made it 
                        1Ô∏è‚É£specefic 
                        2Ô∏è‚É£Measurable

                        5Ô∏è‚É£Time-Bounded 
                        Then I find out the action steps to focus to reach my goal and the possible obstacles and founded the solutions for that Then I started my journey..............
                        1Ô∏è‚É£ Wakeup before 6 
                        2Ô∏è‚É£Reading 20 minutes daily 
                        3Ô∏è‚É£Habit tracking

                        7Ô∏è‚É£ spiritual win
                        All this were the things I do consistently for a week and after that I started to break all the targets  one by one except Reading the only target  I did consistently was reading and I can proudly say that yes iam a reader 

                        ‚úÖHabit tracking 
                        I found this habit tracking one of the most satisfying feeling it's the feeling of making progress it provides a clear evidence of my progress I tried my level best to keep the habit streak alive just like my snap streak i never missed twice if I miss one day I tried my level best to get back on track as quickly as possible 
                        Each measurement provides a little bit of evidence that iam moving in the right direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well doneü´∂
                        ‚úÖLevel up üìö club
                        I describe this book club as one of the best thing that happened this month it's really amazing to be a member of this book club all the guyss here is truly inspiring and I got a lot of insights and learned a lot from everyone as I mentioned above that the only target I did consistently was reading and that's because of the book club  all the guyss there give me the energy to complete my daily dose reading and the urge to post it on the group and I finished my 4 books of the month as l planned and iam really really happy for that it's the first tym in my life iam reading constantly for a month and I feel so proud of myself for completing my target 
                        1.Atomic habit ‚úÖ
                        2.Do epic shit ‚úÖ
                        3.Dopamine detox‚úÖ
                        4.Half girlfriend ‚úÖ
                        ‚úÖMorning jogging
                        Here in delhi the morning walk at the kashmiri park feels like I found  home away from home the way all didi's dada's care for me the mandatory gossip sessions of the aunties all felt like am home moreover the positivity i gained at the morning
                        Even if I met with an accident and not able to continue jogging but the habit tracker motivated me and I started the yoga meditation within the limitations whatever happens I was not ready to stop the routine completely changed my mindset and iam really happy for the things happening around 

                        ‚úÖ Sapienism 
                        The most exciting part of the day meeting a strange person a day and had a chit chat with that person making friends everywhere been  a social being as a first year student at delhi university everything feels so strange even the language culture sab alag alag hhe on behalf of this situation Sapienism gives a better understanding of the people around the culture everything ü´∂

                        ‚úÖSolo date
                        On of the best thing that l have ever done in my life and it's tooo long since I have been waiting for this solo date but I didn't gained that much self love or not conscious about the necessity of being into myself the solo journaling and reading date at lodhi garden gives me a new experience and realised the fact it's the best thing to treat yourself enjoy the vibe with yourself and keep growing üíó

                        Yeahhhhh...........
                        I have made this all work this month and l feels soo soo happy for myself founded a way new way to organize lyf and to moveon from all the hitting realities and to make myself proud and always happy in this journey of shaping myself I founded the truth that I can do all the things I want to do only thing matters effort consistency and the strong desire I just Started to enjoy the process that leads to my goal even if I attained it or not I will enjoy the process..........ü´∂
                        And it's all because of @growithsanaü´∂

                   Hai Sana... iam doing good and great. I planned to be in track this week but PMS started. So iam not forcing my self too much. Still as we have tracker, i try to show up few tasks daily. Now the big change is I started to think about myself (self-love) started focus on me than on others. Learned to be with me and more engaged with myself in a productive way. Thank you so much.

                    Being part of this book club has been so refreshing. I joined this club not because I wanted to start reading - I‚Äôve always loved books and reading, but what I was lacking was consistency. This space gave me exactly that ‚Äî a community to share, stay motivated, and grow together. Seeing the updates and reflections from other members really encourages us to pick up our books again and stay consistent.
                        Now having finished four books and starting fifth in just a month feels like a true achievement, and I‚Äôm so grateful for it. 
                        And Sana Honestly, the way you‚Äôve created this space at such a young age is truly admirable.Thank you for all the effort you put in, it means a lot.‚ú®

                        Here‚Äôs to spaces that makes us pause, reflect and grow.September felt lighter, brighter and more mindful!

                   I am Fatima hanna from Calicut. I have been a reader since I was young. Wherever I saw a book, I would pick it up and read it. When I was in school, I would pick up books from the local library and read them. And when I was in college, I would pick up books from the library and read them. I've been at home for about 8 months now because I am not feeling well. That's why I don't touch or read books very much. The main reason for that is that I don't have any books. I never even thought about buying my own books because I always got free books. I haven't read a book in about 8 months, so it's been very difficult to get back into reading, but this one book club helped get me back into reading. So I bought two books like mine. I also learned how we can romanticize book reading through this book club. Alhamdulillah I completed two books in this month. Now I am reading Third book of this month. The first book I read this month is Atomic habits, and second one ‡¥™‡µã‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥ï‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥¶‡µá‡¥∂‡¥Ç, and now am reading ‡¥Æ‡¥¶‡µÄ‡¥®‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µá‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µç ‡¥í‡¥∞‡µÅ ‡¥™‡µç‡¥∞‡¥£‡¥Ø‡¥≤‡µá‡¥ñ‡¥®‡¥Ç.

                   Hi, I am Rumaisa from Kannur. This book club has significantly changed my reading habits. I am a person who loves to read and collect books. However, even though I collect books, the consistency in reading these books was not going well. I completed a book in 5 months. I tried to complete it quickly, but somehow I couldn't do that.
But this community made me a consistent reader. Now I read every day by spending one hour; I make time for reading. All these are because of the motivation from Sana and everyone in this community. 
Alhamdulillahüòá, I completed 2 books this month, Atomic Habits and Kadeeja, and currently I am reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold, and I have also started to read Forty Rules of Love. 
It's a big achievement for me. Thank you very much, Sana, and everyone.üåù‚ù§Ô∏è

      After seeing Sana‚Äôs videos on Insta, I decided to joined a book club. Something really changed. I got inspired to start reading books and slowly began my reading journey. I also learned how to do things independently without depending too much on others. Joining this group has given me self-improvement and a community of like minded people.
     I haven‚Äôt fully completed a book yet, but I‚Äôm reading in parallel A Man Called Ove, Atomic Habits and Days at the Morisaki Bookshop. These books have already brought many small lifestyle changes, and now whenever I get free time in class, I read. It feels very different and really good for me.

Thank you  Sana ‚ù§Ô∏è
